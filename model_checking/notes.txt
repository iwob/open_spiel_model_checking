Problem with clang++ was solved by removing a folder: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/12 (source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54521402/locating-iostream-in-clang-fatal-error-iostream-file-not-found, answer by suntao). Now /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11 is used.

To build and install open-spiel so that it is visible (and editable) for the model checking utilities, run the following commands:
./install.sh
./open_spiel/scripts/build_and_run_tests.sh
pip3 install -e .
